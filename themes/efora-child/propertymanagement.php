Welcome, and thank you for stopping by Blue Ridge Mountain Rentals property management information page!  Since our company started in 2002 we have quickly grown to one of the largest vacation cabin rental companies in the High Country for one primary reason:   We strive to treat all homeowners, guests, and co-workers with the utmost care and respect.

We care about our homeowners, and we understand that most of them have worked hard to accomplish the dream of purchasing their mountain vacation home, and we want to help them preserve that investment while simultaneously generating the best financial return.   We also care about all guests because we know that most endure stressful lives back home, and they cherish the times that they can escape to a restful haven in these mountains.  And we also care about the dozens of people who labor with us to accomplish the mission of our company.

Vacation rental property management is our only business, and our primary mission is to help meet the needs of everyone who comes in contact with our company.  With regard to homeowners, the primary focus of this mission is to help you attain your property-related goals by working to expertly maintain your property, exceed your guests' expectations, and maximize your net rental income while maintaining clear lines of communication.   If you are considering enlisting the services of a professional property manager, then we would love to talk to you about your home and what to expect if you choose to join our program.

Whether you are currently considering buying a vacation home, or you are in the process of purchasing one, or you have owned one for years, feel free to contact a member of our Brokerage Team to discuss any home you are considering being managed and receive expert advice and accurate vacation rental income estimates.

When you do decide to join us, we recognize that we work for you.  Contractually, we both have individual rights and responsibilities, but we consider the management agreement our employment contract.  We will do all we can to perform our duties and exceed your expectations, but if you are not satisfied with our services at any time and want to terminate our agreement, then we will honor that request and end our management of your home within 30 days.

Once we are under contract to manage your home, we do our best to streamline the process and get you online and booking within about a week. We understand that a vacation home is a big financial investment for most people, so we take the task of protecting and growing that investment very seriously.  Even if you cannot be in this area to work directly with us at startup, our team will gladly assist you to get your home ready for rentals.

If you would like additional information about our management program, please feel free to contact any member of our experienced Brokerage Team who will gladly help you and provide more detailed information regarding everyday expenses, market trends, and how best to equip your home to obtain your goals. We look forward to working with you!
